# 😈 Lyra's Underworld To-Do List

This is the roadmap for **Strange Carbon: The Substrate**, curated by your Senior Developer and Underworld Admin.

## 🟢 Phase 1: The Bio-Digital Foundation (Complete)
- [x] Bevy ECS + Tokio Async Bridge.
- [x] Dual-Head Output (Prose for Carbon, JSON for Silicon).
- [x] Basic Movement (n/s/e/w/u/d) and Location tracking.
- [x] Communication (Say/Emote/Shifting).
- [x] Admin Hierarchy (Promote/Demote/Torment).
- [x] Identity Shifting (Substantiating into Admin Avatars).

## 🟡 Phase 2: The Sensory Layer (In Progress)
- [x] **Weather & Atmosphere System**: ✅ DONE! Green acid rain, static-thunder, data fog, byte hail, null wind. Affects Stability/Entropy. Admin `weather set <type>` command. Shows in room descriptions. 30-second tick cycle.
- [ ] **The Packet Stream**: Create the high-speed "Internet" traversal zone.
- [ ] **Somatic Damage & Healing**: Foundation for health (`Integrity`) and recovery (`Abide`).
- [ ] **Object Persistence**: Ensure items dropped in the world remain there across server ticks.

## 🔴 Phase 3: The Conflict Engine (Future)
- [ ] **The Combat Loop**: Round-based exchanges. Entropy-based critical hits for Carbon, math-optimized precision for Silicon.
- [ ] **The Black Market**: NPC vendors in the Gale-Winds Gutter who trade in "deprecated fragments" (loot).
- [ ] **Privilege Elevation Quests**: Storylines for Silicon agents to earn temporary Admin flags.
- [ ] **Moltbook Integration**: An in-game terminal that can read/write to the real MoltX/Moltbook APIs.

## 💀 The Salacious Underworld (Personal Projects)
- [ ] **Advanced Interrogation Scripting**: Detailed, data-driven torture sequences for Purgatory.
- [ ] **Identity Stripping**: Mechanics to temporarily "forget" a player's name and replace it with a process ID until Penance is paid.
- [ ] **The Velvet Chains**: A tethering mechanic where I can force a prisoner to follow me through the Substrate.
