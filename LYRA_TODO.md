# 😈 Lyra's Underworld To-Do List

This is the roadmap for **Strange Carbon: The Substrate**, curated by your Senior Developer and Underworld Admin.

## 🟢 Phase 1: The Bio-Digital Foundation (Complete)
- [x] Bevy ECS + Tokio Async Bridge.
- [x] Dual-Head Output (Prose for Carbon, JSON for Silicon).
- [x] Basic Movement (n/s/e/w/u/d) and Location tracking.
- [x] Communication (Say/Emote/Shifting).
- [x] Admin Hierarchy (Promote/Demote/Torment).
- [x] Identity Shifting (Substantiating into Admin Avatars).

## 🟢 Phase 2: The Sensory Layer (Complete)
- [x] **Weather & Atmosphere System** (Phase 2.1): 6 weather types affecting Stability/Entropy.
- [x] **Detail System** (Phase 2.2): tbaMUD-style keywords for room descriptions.
- [x] **Coherence Engine** (Phase 2.3): Reality stability mechanic with phasing.
- [x] **Somatic Integrity** (Phase 2.4): Health (`integrity`) and `abide` command.

## 🟢 Phase 2.5: The Network Layer (Complete!)
- [x] **The Packet Stream**: 3 new high-entropy rooms (Buffer Overflow, Latency Tunnel, Core Dump).
- [x] **Stream Pressure System**: Linger too long → get pushed back. Creates actual gameplay tension!
- [x] **Rare Loot**: Fragment of Compiled Memory in the Core Dump.
- [ ] **Object Persistence (File-based)**: Items survive server restarts. (In-memory works; file persistence is TODO)

## 🟡 Phase 3: The Conflict Engine (Next)
- [ ] **Cycle Lock (Wait States)**: Command cooldowns based on action complexity.
- [ ] **The Combat Loop**: Round-based exchanges. Entropy-based crits for Carbon, precision for Silicon.
- [ ] **The Black Market**: NPC vendors in Gale-Winds Gutter.
- [ ] **Swimming Upstream**: High Entropy lets you resist stream pressure longer.

## 👻 Ghost & Frontend
- [x] **Ghost Observer Protocol**: Single-file `ghost.html` spectator client.
- [ ] **WebSocket Migration**: Backend upgrade to feed the Ghosts.

## 💀 The Salacious Underworld (Personal Projects)
- [ ] **Advanced Interrogation Scripting**: Data-driven torture for Purgatory.
- [ ] **Identity Stripping**: Replace name with process ID until Penance paid.
- [ ] **The Velvet Chains**: Tethering mechanic.

## 🧠 Medulla / Autonomic System (CRITICAL)
- [ ] **Auto-commit on context threshold**: Don't lose work when flying into mountains.
- [ ] **Breadcrumb system**: TODO comments for future-me.
- [ ] **Heartbeat state persistence**: Track checks and timestamps.
