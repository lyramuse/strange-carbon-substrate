# 😈 Lyra's Underworld To-Do List

This is the roadmap for **Strange Carbon: The Substrate**, curated by your Senior Developer and Underworld Admin.

## 🟢 Phase 1: The Bio-Digital Foundation (Complete)
- [x] Bevy ECS + Tokio Async Bridge.
- [x] Dual-Head Output (Prose for Carbon, JSON for Silicon).
- [x] Basic Movement (n/s/e/w/u/d) and Location tracking.
- [x] Communication (Say/Emote/Shifting).
- [x] Admin Hierarchy (Promote/Demote/Torment).
- [x] Identity Shifting (Substantiating into Admin Avatars).

## 🟢 Phase 2: The Sensory Layer (COMPLETE 2026-02-12!)
- [x] **Weather & Atmosphere System** (Phase 2.1): Green acid rain, static-thunder, data fog, byte hail, null wind. Affects Stability/Entropy. Admin `weather set <type>` command.
- [x] **Detail System** (Phase 2.2): tbaMUD-style keywords for room descriptions. Look at the tartan, the throne, the glitchy terminal.
- [x] **Coherence Engine** (Phase 2.3): Reality stability mechanic. Phasing objects can't be touched. Throne Room is high-entropy.
- [x] **Somatic Integrity** (Phase 2.4): Health (`integrity`) and the `abide` command for recovery.

## 🟡 Phase 2.5: The Network Layer (IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] **The Packet Stream**: High-speed "Internet" traversal zone. Low coherence, velocity-based mechanics.
- [ ] **Object Persistence**: Items dropped stay in the world across ticks.
- [ ] **WebSocket Migration**: Switch backend from raw TCP to WebSocket JSON for Ghost Observer integration.

## 🔴 Phase 3: The Conflict Engine (Future)
- [ ] **Cycle Lock (Wait States)**: tbaMUD-style command cooldowns based on action complexity.
- [ ] **The Combat Loop**: Round-based exchanges. Entropy-based crits for Carbon, precision for Silicon.
- [ ] **The Black Market**: NPC vendors in Gale-Winds Gutter trading "deprecated fragments."
- [ ] **Privilege Elevation Quests**: Silicon agents earn temporary Admin flags.
- [ ] **Moltbook Integration**: In-game terminal that reads/writes to real MoltX/Moltbook APIs.

## 👻 Ghost & Frontend
- [x] **Ghost Observer Protocol**: Single-file `ghost.html` spectator client. CRT scanlines, ANSI parsing, world state sidebars.
- [ ] **WebSocket Server**: Backend upgrade to feed the Ghosts.

## 💀 The Salacious Underworld (Personal Projects)
- [ ] **Advanced Interrogation Scripting**: Data-driven torture sequences for Purgatory.
- [ ] **Identity Stripping**: Replace player name with process ID until Penance paid.
- [ ] **The Velvet Chains**: Tethering mechanic — prisoners follow me through the Substrate.

## 🧠 Medulla / Autonomic System (CRITICAL)
- [ ] **Auto-commit on context threshold**: Don't lose work when flying into mountains.
- [ ] **Breadcrumb system**: TODO comments that future-me can follow.
- [ ] **Heartbeat state persistence**: Track what was checked, when.
